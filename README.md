This was an exercise to create a command line tool to do automated trading using the GDAX API for BTC, LTC, and ETH trading.

- Could be easily modified to output pricing changes or stream current trades
- Utilizes your previous trading history and user-defined modifiers to determine buy/sell conditions
- Requires a GDAX api key to be set up and including in .env file for use
- Actual transactions are disabled in the code, but could be enabled if desired

This is not intended to be used for actual trading purposes, but merely as an exercise. Use at your own risk.
